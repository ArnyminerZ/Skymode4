# Skymode4

Skymode4 is a project started by [misode](https://twitter.com/misoloo) in 2017. It's a custom skyblock map. It features lots of [modules](https://github.com/misode/Skymode4/wiki/Modules) made by the community, [Gamemode 4](https://gm4.co/modules/) and custom made for this project. It is currently not yet released, but feel free to look around on the [wiki](https://github.com/misode/Skymode4/wiki) or in the code.
